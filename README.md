## Introduction
San Francisco is located in the northern part of California with a population of 870,000 people and covering a land area of roughly about 46.87 square miles. SF is filled with beautiful attractions such as the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, and even the Golden Gate park. This beautiful city is surrounding by water and is blessed with the beautiful California weather, thus making San Francisco a top choice for tourism and a place you can call home. However, San Francisco does have a few knicks that I would like to point out. With the rise in technology, living expenses in San Francisco are constantly sky rocketing. There are also a lot of crimes located in tightly dense populated areas of San Francisco.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to be able to identiy the major impacts that crimes have on the city of San Francisco. I will analyze which areas experience the most crimes and why. I want to be able to see if crimes will have a significant impact on the houseing market. My analysis will allow the Police Department to see when, where, and what type of crimes will most likely happen. With this information, they will be able to allocate the neccessary units to the right areas throughout the day. Also, I will be able to bring awareness to residence and tourists by informing them of precautions to take depending on the area they're visiting. Lastly, future residence will be able to see if there are any correlations between the crimes rates and the current housing market to know if they're getting the right price.
